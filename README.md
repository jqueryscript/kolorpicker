Kolorpicker is a simple jQuery based component to display a color picker and palette selector upon selection of an html input text field.

This particular color picker offers a tile based method of selecting colors, which separates it from the many photoshop-style color pickers currently available.
How to Implement

1. Include jquery within your HEAD block
2. Include kolorpicker within your HEAD block
3. Add class "kolorPicker" to your input field
